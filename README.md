# Life-Saver
## Inspiration
In the covid situation, we saw that the person who suffered more is the elder person who lives alone (i.e., the elder people are in a situation where they canâ€™t able to contact anybody in the bad situation).
Taking this as an inspiration our team intended to provide a solution (hardware + software) that rectifies the issue with utmost security.

## What it does
We have proposed to monitor the most common health issues that were faced by elder people and keep them updated in real-time, using that database it is used to process some activities which will save the lives of the elder people.
